        {key: 3, title: "why is misery a sober space?", description: "it‚Äôs not that we set out with a strictly sober vibe in mind, but the more we thought about it, the clearer it became that if we were trying to make some kind of real mental health intervention, we‚Äôd need people to be present for it. when we started out, trying to run a sober rave in an accessible venue in london on a friday or saturday night got us laughed at. nightlife, venues and as a result queer events programming is completely beholden to alcohol sales, hence the lack of sober spaces available. sober spaces aren‚Äôt just a health asset, but an anti-capitalist one too, which, call us dated or whatever, feels important. we‚Äôve built misery - using harm reduction principles - as a non-judgmental space. we do not police anyone‚Äôs relationship to substances or what they do before or after our events. everyone is welcome, whatever their relationship to substance use and sobriety. we understand people‚Äôs trepidations about sober spaces. addiction rhetoric has historically been chock-full of judgement, moralism, unhelpful and unrealistic goal setting, and inherently shaming language like ‚Äúgetting clean‚Äù. we‚Äôre careful not to replicate these sometimes well-meaning but ultimately damaging frameworks and are looking instead to use our understanding of radical mental health practices which centre the voices of people in need, to create opportunities for marginalised people to have fun in alcohol-free spaces. we do this for friends actively struggling with mental health and/or substance use issues, for people who are curious about their relationship to intoxication and wellness, and for people who just want to have a good time. for many of us, moments of freedom are often facilitated by a kind of dissociation and self-medication that can only be provided by alcohol and other drugs. we deserve some other options too. if you have any questions or concerns about this, and where you fit in with it all, we are here to chat with you."},
       
       
        {key: 4, title: "what is harm reduction & why do you love it so much?", description: "harm reduction is a mental health framework that was developed in the uk in the 1980s in response to the increasing number of hiv cases among drug injectors. rather than shaming drug users, this radical rethinking resulted in the establishment of syringe exchange schemes, where injecting drug users were able to obtain sanitary hypodermic needles at little or no cost, reducing the spread of hiv. harm reduction is now applied globally as a way of engaging with communities and people who may be participating in risky behaviours without shaming, judging, stigmatising or simply telling them to stop. instead, it encourages us to support, listen, help inform others of risks and potential safety measures, and honour eachother‚Äôs agency to make choices for ourselves. this can be with regard to drinking, drugs, sex, self-harm ‚Äì anything really.  haters will say that harm reduction increases the likelihood of people doing risky things, but it doesn‚Äôt. there are many studies that prove it doesn‚Äôt but also fuck a study and consider it. if we work to remove the stigma and judgement that so often silences and isolates vulnerable people and their coping mechanisms, and listen to them instead, it makes sense that they might feel more cared for and therefore empowered to do what‚Äôs right for them with the knowledge, support and resources to be safe while they‚Äôre doing it. this feels particularly important when thinking about qtibpoc who by nature of being othered so many times over are no strangers to judgement, guilt and shame and can so easily internalise the belief that they are not worthy of care."},
